# **Introspection**
## Why must we choose you?

I had been introduced to coding recently and it has been in my head ever since.
If I don't know, I learn and move ahead. That's my policy. I would like to make my mark in the field of app developement
And since amfoss already ahs a skillful set of members, I would like to learn from the best and share my experience with the uprising enthusiasists.

## What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Well, my plan is to maintain a good score in academics and involve in more programming activities beyond curriculum, and find my drive in coding ASAP.

## How would you contribute back to the club?
I am looking for platforms where I can learn a lot and progress in this field.So,I will try my maximum to involve in projects and be a contributer in the workforce.
Will take guidance and come up with ideas that can be helpful and devote my energy, time and quirky thoughts to the upliftment of this prestigious club.

## Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Actually, I believe this selection process is meant to be a hurdle to see if the candidate is willing to spend his/her time in this field of course, outside academics and other activities,
rather than a hunt for coders in excellence. So, as far as I know, this selection process is great. We also have our responsive and hospital mentors and our dear friend Google to help us out when we were stuck;)
