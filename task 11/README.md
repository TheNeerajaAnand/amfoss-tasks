***Poster:***

I had created a poster by collaborating both Adobe Photoshop and canva.com.

I had initially made my poster in Adobe Photoshop and added the special effects via canva.

This task was really enjoyable, annd fun. Blurring my picture and the background was time consuming. 

But the editing work took less than an hour to complete.
