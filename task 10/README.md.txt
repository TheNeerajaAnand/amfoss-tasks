CS50:  I had learnt this course of weeks 0,1,6,and 7. These were useful in my academics too. Hence i pursued this one. I found the scratch project to be very cute and exciting. 
I couldnt get enough of making sprites and working with them.I haven't finished the rest of the psets, but I'm gonna work on it in the course of time. I dont want to leave it incomplete.
