# ***Installing Ubuntu 20.04:***
 I had downloaded the ubuntu file from the desktop website. I installed a software RUFUS, with which i created a partition in my D: drive, for windows and ubuntu.
I moved the ubuntu file into my flash s=drive, installed, and got it dual booted with windows using the Windows boot manager.Currently it is working fine. I had a small error while setting the 
ubuntu, where I had a mess with the ubuntu piot. I had sorted that problem out with some good help from the mentors.
