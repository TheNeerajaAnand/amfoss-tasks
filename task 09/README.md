# ***Spamming spaghetti:***

I had first created an account in telegram web and decided to spam my father with 20 'Hi' messages.

I got the java code by extensive google checks and tries, and then understood the working of the code, eventhough i was not familiarised with the java language.

I copied the code into my clipboard and added some variation in the count interval and number of times, the message and the clearinterval method.

I opened the Java console(Ctrl+Shift+J)and pasted my rendered code there. and hit enter,this made my code be sent to the recipient 20 times in 100ms interval between consecutive ones.
