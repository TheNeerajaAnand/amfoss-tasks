# ***Flutter:***

I was able to install and set up flutter console by following the instructions. 

I went to the flutter homepage, and installed flutter for Windows.

And after downloading the .exe file, I had done proper installation into my D:drive after installing git in my laptop.

I had verified the presence of git in my system by going to clp, and typing git and hitting enter.

But had not invested much time to complete this task eventhough it was really interesting.

I am planning to complete this in this coming month itself.
